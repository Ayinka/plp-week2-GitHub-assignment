1 Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It enables developers to:

Track changes in their codebase.
Collaborate with others without overwriting changes.
Revert to earlier versions when necessary.

2 Log in to your GitHub account.
Click on New Repository.
Enter a repository name (e.g., MyProject).
Add an optional description for clarity.
Choose the repository visibility: Public or Private.
Optionally initialize the repository 

3  A README is the first point of reference for anyone visiting your repository.

4 	  Public Repository	                 Private Repository
Access	Open to everyone; anyone can view it.	 Only accessible to invited collaborators.
Collaboration	Ideal for open-source projects.	 Suitable for proprietary or sensitive work.
